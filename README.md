My entry for the [Gopher Gala](http://gophergala.com) (23-25 Jan 2015)


### Concepts

An online "Go code editor" that let's you run Go code and interact
with your friends (chat, code editing).


  *Isn't that just like the [Go playground](http://play.golang.org)?*

Maybe ... But it adds "mutli-user" features and the editor is very "hipster".
